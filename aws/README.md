# AWS all resource collection
## AWS resource by *Mohammad Mahdee-uz Zaman* sir
Let’s start the amazing journey!!!
Welcome everyone to the AWS Career. We will be discussing a number of skills, career and resource related topics here. If you are serious about building your career in Cloud Computing, stay here, otherwise feel free to remove yourself from here.

<br>
You will be challenged continuously to learn and apply latest technologies in the cloud. You will start with cloud foundations, and then add further skills to enhance it.
<br>

I am expecting, at absolute minimum you are spending 15 hours per week. Some of you would be able to finish within 10 hours, some of you would need 20 hours. If you wish, and have more time, you can even progress further. There will be series of learnings you would need to accomplish. I will not be baby-sitting, meaning not keep asking you for it; this is your career, so, you would need to do this. Again, if you don’t think it is for you, feel free to exit.
<br>

Starting now, to next 15 years, I foresee the cloud computing will dominate the Information Technology; and specially AWS, as they have the broadest and deepest set of capabilities. The person whoever is the expert on those, they would have significant leverage. At the same time, you need to be extremely humble, as the knowledge is infinite, and we would never know it all! So, let’s not act like one.
<br>

This team will be leading the cloud computing technologies in Bangladesh, and always be in demand. I personally don’t think job will be any issue, as long as you are willing to always push forward.
<br>

So, one more time, if you are willing to 

- (1) work extremely hard; 
- (2) build a career in cloud computing; 
- (3) ALWAYS enhance your skills;
- (4) be extremely humble; 
- (5) be super disciplined… 
<br>

this is for you!! Looking forward to working to build the leaders in builders for information technologies!!
<br>

We will jump right it.. What do I expect?
<br>

I expect all of you, without exception to acknowledge each and every message I send out. If you miss to acknowledge, I would assume, you did not read that. You can simply say, “Got It” or “Acknowledged”.
